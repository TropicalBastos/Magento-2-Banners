## Overview straight from the marketplace
Perhaps you're looking for a way to liven up your store and market your products throughout the store? Well look no further. Header Banner Images for Magento 2 gives you the ability to add header banners and banner backgrounds to your pages be it a Product page, Category page or CMS page.

This is particularly useful if you want to upload custom images that showcase the products on your store, or even if you just want to make your store look a bit more visually expressive. For example if you have a category page that displays clothing, why not add a header image to show to your users how epic and shiny your clothing products are in that category?

There are two ways you can add header images: you can either add one image (which scales it to the full width of the screen) or add a background image and then add an inner contained image (which scales the background image to full screen while keeping the inner image contained within the site's container).

Features:
Add a banner image to any category page to bring it to life
Add a banner image to any product page to promote similar products etc
Add a banner image to any CMS page to further customise its look
Add unique banners to every single page-based entity in your store, giving your store a bespoke feel
The ability to add a background image for a particular banner image is included
Style the banners with CSS as they are exposed via simple css classes making styling very easy
Freedom to upload any wide-ratio image as aspect ratio is adjusted
